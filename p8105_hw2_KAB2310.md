\#Cleaning data

``` r
nyc_transit_clean = nyc_transit_df |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    line = line, 
    station = station_name, 
    name = station_name, 
    station_latitude = station_latitude, 
    station_longitude = station_longitude, 
    route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11,
    entry = entry, 
    vending = vending, 
    entrance_type = entrance_type, 
    ada = ada
  ) |>
  
  unite(routes_served, route1:route11, sep = ", ", na.rm = TRUE) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "yes", TRUE, FALSE))

nrow(nyc_transit_clean)
```

    ## [1] 1868

``` r
ncol(nyc_transit_clean)
```

    ## [1] 10

The nyc transit clean data set has 1868 observations and 10 variables.
The data set contain the following variables: line, station, name,
station latitude, station longitude, routes served, entry, vending,
entrance type and ada. I selected and retained the 10 variables.
Additionally, I combined the 11 routes in using the unite() function to
create a new column called “route_served”. The size of data set is 1868
and 10. Since each row in the data set corresponds with the correct
attribute, I believe the data is tidy. There are no missing variables
from previewing the nyc transit clean data set.

\#Answer the following questions using these data:

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified
both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway;
125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

``` r
distinct_stations = nyc_transit_clean |>
  distinct(station, line)

distinct_stations =
  nrow(distinct_stations)

distinct_stations
```

    ## [1] 465

There are 465 distinct stations.

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ada_compliant_stations =  nyc_transit_clean |>
  filter(ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(station, line) |> 
  nrow()

ada_compliant_stations
```

    ## [1] 84

There are 84 stations with ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
without_vending_data = nyc_transit_df |>
  filter(Vending == "NO")

allow_entry_proportion <- without_vending_data %>%
  summarise(proportion = mean(Entry == "YES")) %>%
  pull(proportion)

allow_entry_proportion
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

37.7% of station entrances or exits that do not have vending machines
still allow people to enter the station.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
nyc_transit_reformat = nyc_transit_clean |>
  separate_rows(routes_served, sep = ", ")  
view (nyc_transit_reformat)

a_train_stations = nyc_transit_reformat |>
  filter(routes_served == "A") |>
  distinct(station, line)  

 nrow(a_train_stations)
```

    ## [1] 60

``` r
 ada_compliant_a_train_stations = nyc_transit_reformat |>
  filter(routes_served == "A", ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(station, line)
 
 nrow(ada_compliant_a_train_stations)
```

    ## [1] 17

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. Of the 60, 17 are
ADA complaint.

# Mr Trash Wheel sheet

    ## New names:

``` r

  select(where(~ !all(is.na(.))))

view(mr_trash_wheel)

#There are 584 observations and 15 variables in Mr. Trash Wheel Data set. Some of the key variables consist of dumpster, month, year, date, weight tons, volume cubic yards, plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles, plastic bottles, wrappers, sports balls and homes powered. Extra columns (2)  were accidentally added in the data manipulation process, so I removed them in lines 122-123.

#There are 106 observations and 14 variables. Some of the key variables consist of dumpster, month, year, date, weight tons, volume cubic yards, plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles, plastic bags, wrappers, home powered, and trash wheel.

#There are 155 observations and 13 variables. Some of the key variables consist of dumpster, month, year, date, weight tons, volume cubic yards, plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, plastic bags, wrappers, homes powered, and trash wheel.

gwynnda_june2022 = trash_wheels_df |>
  filter(trash_wheel == "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", 
         year == 2022, 
         month == 6)

total_cig_butts = gwynnda_june2022 |>
  summarize(total_cigarette_butts = sum(cigarette_butts, na.rm = TRUE))

total_cig_butts

    ##                   <dbl>
    ## 1                     0

The size of the resulting data set, trash_wheels_df is 845 and \`r
ncol(trash_wheels_df). Some of the key variables are trash wheel, sports
balls, dumpster, month, year, date, weight tons, volume cubic yards,
plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles, plastic
bottles, wrappers and homes powered. The total weight of trash collected
by Professor Trash Wheel is 216. The total number of cigarette butts
collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022 is 0.
