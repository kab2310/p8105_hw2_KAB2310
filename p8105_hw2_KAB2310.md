\#Cleaning data

``` r
nyc_transit_clean = nyc_transit_df |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    line = line, 
    station = station_name, 
    name = station_name, 
    station_latitude = station_latitude, 
    station_longitude = station_longitude, 
    route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11,
    entry = entry, 
    vending = vending, 
    entrance_type = entrance_type, 
    ada = ada
  ) |>
  
  unite(routes_served, route1:route11, sep = ", ", na.rm = TRUE) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "yes", TRUE, FALSE))

nrow(nyc_transit_clean)
```

    ## [1] 1868

``` r
ncol(nyc_transit_clean)
```

    ## [1] 10

The nyc transit clean data set has 1868 observations and 10 variables.
The data set contain the following variables: line, station, name,
station latitude, station longitude, routes served, entry, vending,
entrance type and ada. I selected and retained the 10 variables.
Additionally, I combined the 11 routes in using the unite() function to
create a new column called “route_served”. The size of data set is 1868
and 10. Since each row in the data set corresponds with the correct
attribute, I believe the data is tidy. There are no missing variables
from previewing the nyc transit clean data set.

\#Answer the following questions using these data:

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified
both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway;
125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

``` r
distinct_stations = nyc_transit_clean |>
  distinct(station, line)

distinct_stations =
  nrow(distinct_stations)

distinct_stations
```

    ## [1] 465

There are 465 distinct stations.

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ada_compliant_stations =  nyc_transit_clean |>
  filter(ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(station, line) |> 
  nrow()

ada_compliant_stations
```

    ## [1] 84

There are 84 stations with ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
without_vending_data = nyc_transit_df |>
  filter(Vending == "NO")

allow_entry_proportion <- without_vending_data %>%
  summarise(proportion = mean(Entry == "YES")) %>%
  pull(proportion)

allow_entry_proportion
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

37.7% of station entrances or exits that do not have vending machines
still allow people to enter the station.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
nyc_transit_reformat = nyc_transit_clean |>
  separate_rows(routes_served, sep = ", ")  
view (nyc_transit_reformat)

a_train_stations = nyc_transit_reformat |>
  filter(routes_served == "A") |>
  distinct(station, line)  

 nrow(a_train_stations)
```

    ## [1] 60

``` r
 ada_compliant_a_train_stations = nyc_transit_reformat |>
  filter(routes_served == "A", ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(station, line)
 
 nrow(ada_compliant_a_train_stations)
```

    ## [1] 17

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. Of the 60, 17 are
ADA complaint.
